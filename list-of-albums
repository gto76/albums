Greatest Albums of All Time
===========================
Albums are rated by how well they sound when listened from start to the end without interruptions. That's the reason why there is no Nevermind by Nirvana or Rain Dogs by Tom Waits on the list, since they contain a few songs that ruin the flow of the albums.
