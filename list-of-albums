Greatest Albums of All Time
===========================
Albums are rated by how well they sound when listened to from beginning to end without interruptions. That's the reason why there is no Nevermind by Nirvana or Rain Dogs by Tom Waits, since they contain a few songs that ruin the flow. There are also no live albums or compilations.
