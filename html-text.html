Greatest Albums of All Time</h1>

<p>Albums are rated by how well they sound <b><u>when listened to from beginning to the end without interruptions</u></b>. That's the reason why there is no <i>Nevermind</i> by Nirvana or <i>Rain Dogs</i> by Tom Waits on the list, since they contain a few songs that ruin the flow of the record. There are also no live albums or compilations.
