Greatest Albums of All Time</h1>

<p>Albums are rated by how well they sound <b>when listened to from beginning to the end without interruptions</b>. That's the reason why there is no Nevermind by Nirvana or Rain Dogs by Tom Waits on the list, since they contain a few songs that ruin the flow of the record. There are also no live albums or compilations.
